### What was discussed at the May 20th City Council meeting?

* The meeting covered a range of topics including the approval of a refund for the Stanly Ranch Residential project impact fee, authorizing a construction contract for the Coombs & South Coombs Street Rehabilitation project, proclaiming May 2025 as Historic Preservation Month, addressing public comments on issues such as time limits for speakers, potential changes to healthcare services at Queen of the Valley Medical Center, and traffic signal efficiency, receiving an update on CalPERS pension funding and the city's Section 115 trust, discussing and adopting updated fire hazard severity zone maps and related municipal code amendments, and interviewing candidates for the Measure G Citizens Oversight Committee.

### What is the Coombs & South Coombs Street Rehabilitation project?

* This project involves the rehabilitation of Coombs Street and South Coombs Street from Imola Avenue to 5th Street. A significant construction contract was authorized to Ghilotti Bros., Inc., in the amount of $4,695,445.70. The project includes numerous traffic safety features such as adding red curbs near crosswalks, reducing traffic lane widths to encourage slower speeds and improve bike access (including new northbound and shared southbound bike lanes), adding bulb-outs where feasible to shorten crosswalks, installing new rectangular rapid flashing beacons (RFBs) at several intersections, and incorporating high-visibility crosswalks. The project aims to improve safety for pedestrians and cyclists and will utilize a "complete streets" approach.

### What is the significance of proclaiming May 2025 as Historic Preservation Month?

* The proclamation recognizes the importance of protecting historic, cultural, and architectural resources for future generations, aligning with the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 and the official designation of May as Preservation Month in 1973. The City of Napa has a rich collection of preserved 19th and 20th-century buildings, reflecting community stewardship. The proclamation encourages citizens to support and participate in efforts to protect and celebrate these places that shape Napa's history and future. The Executive Director of Napa County Landmarks was present to accept the proclamation and highlighted the vitality of Napa's past for its future, mentioning public engagement through exhibits and new programs supporting legacy businesses.

### What concerns were raised by the public during the meeting?

* Public comments covered various issues. One speaker expressed frustration with the three-minute time limit for comments at Planning Commission meetings, particularly regarding issues related to music and amplified noise, and difficulty in contacting commissioners via email. Another speaker, representing the National Union of Healthcare Workers (NUHW), raised concerns about potential changes to outpatient lab services and staffing restructuring at Queen of the Valley Medical Center, highlighting the impact on patients and the community. Another speaker discussed issues with traffic signal efficiency at specific intersections and expressed safety concerns about bicycling on certain streets, also mentioning a past legal case regarding redwood tree removal in Kennedy Park. Additionally, representatives from the Napa Youth Council spoke about the prevalence of youth vaping in school bathrooms and advocated for a tobacco retail license to limit youth access to tobacco products.

### How is the city addressing its long-term financial obligations like pension liabilities?

* The city is committed to fiscal sustainability through long-term financial planning. This includes fully funding reserves and prefunding pension contributions through a Section 115 trust. As of June 30, 2024, the city had approximately $8.3 million in its 115 trust. An actuary presented on CalPERS pension funding and the city's unfunded liability, which is significant despite the funds in the 115 trust. The actuary explained that the 115 trust provides flexibility for the city to decide when and how to use the funds for pension contributions, unlike regular CalPERS contributions which are mandatory. The presentation also discussed different strategies for addressing unfunded liabilities, such as making one-time contributions or budgeting for additional annual payments, and the pros and cons of keeping funds in internal reserves, a 115 trust, or directly contributing to CalPERS.

### What are the recent updates regarding fire hazard severity zones in Napa?

* The City is in the process of adopting updated fire hazard severity zone maps as required by the state, which were last updated in 2011 for local responsibility areas. These maps identify areas with moderate, high, and very high fire hazard severity. The City of Napa has identified areas within city limits as having high fire hazard severity zones, but none with very high severity zones, which have significantly stricter building requirements. The proposed action involves adopting these state-provided maps and amending a section of the municipal code to align with the California Fire Code and ensure broader application by city development staff. The updated code includes requirements for fire hazard reduction information in project proposals, such as fire protection plans, landscape plans with long-term vegetation management, and creating defensible space. There is also discussion about the appeal process for properties included in these zones and potential future adjustments to the state maps.

### What is the Measure G Citizens Oversight Committee and why are candidates being interviewed?

* Measure G is a local ballot measure that is expected to generate approximately $22 million per year in revenue for the city. A Citizens Oversight Committee is being established to review and report on the expenditures of these tax revenues to ensure transparency and accountability and that the funds are being spent as intended for critical infrastructure improvements and services. Candidates with varying professional backgrounds and community involvement were interviewed by the City Council for positions on this committee, including designated roles for individuals with experience in finance and municipal operations or capital project delivery. The interview process involved assessing candidates' understanding of the committee's role, their qualifications, and their ideas for effectively communicating with the public.

### What is the significance of the Vehicle License Fee (VLF) in relation to Measure G?

* The Vehicle License Fee (VLF) was mentioned in the context of the Measure G oversight committee and the city's financial planning. It was noted that the VLF provides a significant amount of funding to the city, and there are concerns that this state funding could potentially be reduced or eliminated in the future. Measure G is seen as a potential safety net or stop-gap measure to help maintain service levels if VLF funding decreases or goes away. The oversight committee is expected to understand and potentially communicate how Measure G funds help the city respond to changes in macroeconomic conditions and maintain services, including explaining how Measure G could help mitigate the impact of losing VLF funding.
